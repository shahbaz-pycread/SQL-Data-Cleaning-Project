# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project

Data cleaning project of Nashville Housing. Datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx).

Used SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX to spilt the data in the column. PARSENAME is the another method used in the project to spilt the data. CTE and window functions are used to find the 
duplicate records in the table.
